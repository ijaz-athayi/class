examples:
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = 30;
let name =" ijaz";

operators:
	arithmatic operators.
	comparison operators.
	assignment operators.
	logical operators.
	bitwise operators.

1. arithmatic operators:

	addition       +    = adding some of the numbers.
	subraction     -    = subracting some of the numbers.
	multiplicatin  *    = muliply some of numbers.
	division       /    = divide some of numbers
	reminder       %    = it is a reminer comes from division. 
	exponential    **   = it is the power of number1 to number2 
							{eg.(5 ** 3) 5 the power of 3 }
	increment      ++   = it increase the number.
							{eg."(++x) = 11 " hereafter the value of x is 11 but
								"(x++) = 10"  it cant change but hereafter x value is 11(it means after to this will change)
							}
	decrement      --   =
							{eg."(--x) = 9 " hereafter the value of x is 9 but
								"(x--) = 10"  it cant change but hereafter x value is 9(it means after to this will change)
							}
							
2. comparison operators:
	//relational operatiors
	greater than	   >   it gives boolean resoponse (true or false)
	less than		   <
	greater than equal >= 
	less than equal    >= 
	
	//equality operators
	datatype equal	===
	value equal to	==
	not equal to	!==
	
	//string comparison
	('alen' > 'anbu') it changes into dictionary mode;
	//a  =   a
	//l  != n  "l is first then n" so true.
	
	// comparison of different type 
	("1" < 5) its true because it see the number inside the string 
	(true < 1) its true 1 = true   then  
						0 = false
